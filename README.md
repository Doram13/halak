Petunia is a decent little country with a strong and wise leader. 
He sets wise laws in order to keep the country safe, stable, and prosperous.
For example it is forbidden to use the word 'dictator' since it induces 
uneasiness and threatens peace.

Pet Un, the wise leader, likes if the history of the country reflects all
the up to date information scholars have at any given moment. There is a 
central, authoritative source of information about historical facts
called `TheHistory` which must be updated by historians any time they become
aware of a new piece of fact.

For example, some would mistakenly say that the country's main victories 
have been fought at the time Pet Un's father, Pet Il was in rule - this 
is an example of dangerous and misleading information that has to be erased 
and set straight in the official version.

And another thing. Performance is of utmost importance; Pet Un personally 
ordered that `TheHistory` must be as fast as possible.

The IT specialists at _The History Institute_ chose to keep the current 
state of history as a bunch of words. They knew about
arrays, but also heard that there are multiple list implementations in Java 
to choose from with different performance characteristics. They piloted a
research project to check the difference between String[], ArrayList<String>,
and LinkedList<String>. Help them to implement all the necessary methods 
with the best possible performance!

1) So your main task is to fill the `//TODO` sections. `removeWord()` is 
the easiest, `replaceMoreWords()` is much more trickier.

2) To get better performance, you should look up `iterator` and `listIterator`!

3) Additionally you might convert `TheHistory` into an interface
with various implementations and get rid of those ugly switch
statements.
